         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMongſt all the Wonderful and Prodigious Creatures that have been ſeen in this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the Age of Man, none ſo ſtrange, nor ſo great as an Elephant, and which is more, it cometh neareſt in wit and capacity, to man, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith; for they underſtand the Language of that Country wherein they are bred: they do whatſoever they are commanded, they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what duty they are taught, and withal take delight both in love and glory: Nay, more then all this, they embrace good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, honeſty, prudence, and equity, (rare qualities to be found in men) and withal have in Religion, reverence, (with a kind of Devotion) not onely the Stars and planets, but the Sun and Moon they alſo worſhip. And ſome writers report thus much of them, that when the New Moon beg<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neth to appear bright, they come down to a certain River named <hi>Amelus,</hi> in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts and Forreſts of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> where after they are waſhed, and daſhed themſelves all over with the water, and have ſaluted and adored, after their manner that planet, they return again into the woods, carrying before them their young Calves, that be wearied and tired. Moreover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are thought to have a ſenſe of Religion and Conſcience in others; for when they are to paſs the Seas into another Countrey, they will not Embarque before they be induced thereunto by an Oath of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, that they ſhall return again; and ſeeing there have been divers of them, being infeebled by ſickneſs (for as big as they be, ſubject they are to grievous Malladies) to lie upon their backs, caſting and flinging Herbs up towards Heaven, as if they had procured and ſet the Earth to pray for them. Now for their Docility and aptneſs to learn any thing, the King they adore they kneel before him, and offer unto him Garlands and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of Flowers, and green Herbs. The leſſer ſort of them, which they call Baſtards, ſerve the <hi>Indians</hi> in good ſtead to plow their Ground.</p>
            <p>They breed in that part of <hi>Africk</hi> which lyeth beyond the Deſerts of <hi>Syrtes:</hi> alſo in <hi>Maurita<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ia,</hi> they are found alſo amongſt the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> and <hi>Troglodites,</hi> but <hi>India</hi> bringeth forth the biggeſt: as alſo the Dragons that are continually at variance with them, and evermore fighting, and thoſe of ſuch great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that they can eaſily claſp and wind round about the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and withal, tye them faſt with a Knot. In this Conflict they dye, both the one and the other: the Elephant falls down dead as conquered, and with his heavy weight cruſheth and Squeeezeth the Dragon that is wound and wreathed about him.</p>
            <p>In <hi>India,</hi> from whence this Elephant came, they take them in this manner: The Governour driveth one of them that are tame, into the Chaſe and Forreſts, and when he can meet with one of them alone, or ſingle him from the Herd, he beateth the wild beaſt till he hath made him weary, and then he mounteth upon him, and ruleth him as well as the other.</p>
            <p>In Africk they catch them in great ditches, which they make for that purpoſe, unto which if one of them chance to fall, and cannot get out; ſo ſoon as he is ſeen by other Elephants, they imediately come to ſuccour him, they bring all the boughs they can get, and put them into the Ditch, then rowl down blocks and ſtones, and any thing that will ſerve to raiſe a banck, then ſtrive all they can to pluck him out.</p>
            <p>The manner of taming (as furious and raging mad as they be ſometimes] is with hunger and ſtripes; but men muſt have the help of other Elephants that are tame already, to reſtrain the unruly Beaſt with ſtrong Chains, In the Indian and Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Wars they ſerved to carry Caſtles with armed Men on their backs, to enter the Squadrons and battalions of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and for the moſt part, all the ſervice in the Wars of the Eaſt, was performed by them, they broke the ranks, bore down armed men that were in their way, and ſtamped them under foot. Theſe terrible beaſts [as outragious as they ſeem) are frighted with the leaſt grunting of a Swine.</p>
            <p>They breed but once in all their l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e 200 years, ſome of them 300. Their youthful time and ſtrength of age beginneth when they be ſixty years old, but this which is brought over into England is ſaid to be but ſeven.</p>
            <p>The Truncks and bodies of Trees is the beſt meat they have, and therein take moſt delight. They chew and eat their Meat with their mouth, but they breath, drink, and ſmell with their Trunck, which is not improperly called their hand. Of all other living creatures they cannot abide a Mouſe or a Rat, and if they perceive their provinder lying in the Manger taſt or ſcent never ſo little of them, they refuſe it, and will not touch it. They are mightily tormented with pain, if they chance in their Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſwallow down an Horſe-Leech, for as ſoon as the horſe-Leech hath ſettled faſt in his Wind-Pipe it putteth him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable pains; their skin or their backs is moſt tough and hard, but the fleſh ſoft and tender, covered their skin is neither with hair nor briſle, no not ſo much as in their tail, which might ſerve them in good ſtead to drive away their troubleſome flyes. Their skin is full of croſs wrinckles, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, the ſmell thereof is able to draw ſuch vermine to it; and therefore when they are laid ſtretched along, and perceive the flyes ſettle in ſwarms on their skins, ſuddenly th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y draw ſuch cranies together cloſe, and ſo cruſh them all to Death: their teeth bear a very high price, and were reckoned very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable by the Heathens, to make the Stautes and Images of their Gods; but the greateſt uſe that we make of them here, is to make Combs, as we may ſee here at moſt Comb-makers doors in London.</p>
            <p>Now having given you an account of their underſtanding, how they breed, the manner of taking and taming of them, I will now inform you of one lately brought over into England, and give you a full Deſcription of it, as thus: This Elephant is of a Dun colour, the body of it [though but young) is bigger then the bodies of two horſes, a ſtrange, wonderful, and mighty large head, with a Trunk or Noſtril extending a yard down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Eyes but ordinary, Ears like a Blood-Hound, hanging down, Legs as big or bigger than an ordinary mans body, and feet proportionable, &amp;c. But this being not above ſeven years old, is not grown the ſixth part to what it will be about ſixty years hence, if it live ſo long.</p>
            <p>If any perſons are deſirous to ſee this wonder of Beaſts, let them repair to the <hi>Riſing-Star</hi> in St. <hi>Johns-Court,</hi> neer <hi>Clerkenwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green,</hi> where they may have true information, where they may ſee it, it being kept neer it.</p>
